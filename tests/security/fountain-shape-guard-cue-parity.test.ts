// server/lib/validation.ts's fountainShapeRejectionReason() vs.
// src/lib/fountain.ts's CHARACTER_CUE_RE — cue-definition parity
// (2026-09-04, adversarial audit + independent review, same day).
//
// ROUND 1 (audit). The guard's distinct-cue-line detector used its own local
// proxy, `CUE_LIKE_LINE_RE = /^[A-Z0-9 .,'()&\-]{1,40}$/` — ASCII-only, with a
// 40-char cap — while the analyzer's real cue test, CHARACTER_CUE_RE, is
// Unicode (`\p{Lu}\p{Lt}`), allows `#`, and has no length cap. Non-ASCII
// capitals (Cyrillic, Greek, accented Latin), `#`, and 41+-char cues were
// invisible to the guard. Fixed by composing a new CUE_LIKE_LINE_RE from
// src/lib/fountain.ts's exported CUE_INITIAL_CLASS/CUE_LETTER_CLASS classes.
//
// ROUND 2 (independent review, same day). The round-1 fix was STILL a
// second, independently hand-composed grammar, and it missed a real cue
// shape: the dual-dialogue `^` marker CHARACTER_CUE_RE accepts via
// `\s*\^?\s*` (src/lib/fountain.ts:139). 2,000 distinct `PERSON<i>^` cues
// reached the analyzer unrejected. Fixed by making the guard's predicate
// (`isCueLikeLine`, exported from validation.ts) a PROVABLE superset of
// CHARACTER_CUE_RE BY CONSTRUCTION — `CHARACTER_CUE_RE.test(line) ||
// CUE_LIKE_LINE_RE.test(line)` — so no future hand-composed class can
// silently narrow it again. Part 1b below is the implication proof this
// guarantee is checked, not merely asserted.
//
// ROUND 3 (independent review, same finding set). MAX_FOUNTAIN_DISTINCT_CUE_LINES
// bounds distinct cue VOCABULARY, not analyzer COST: 1,500 distinct cues
// repeated many times is legal under that bound alone and measured (outside
// this file, against runScriptDoctor directly) at 39s for 20 repeats and a
// non-terminating request at 34 repeats. Fixed with a second bound,
// MAX_FOUNTAIN_CUE_WEIGHT, on distinct-cue-lines x total-cue-line-occurrences
// (a cost proxy, not a vocabulary proxy) — see validation.ts's own comment
// for the measurement grid this bound was chosen from. Part 3 below proves a
// realistic feature-length script and every committed fixture clear the new
// bound with wide margin.
